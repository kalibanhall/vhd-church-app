🎉 VALIDATION API FIX COMPLETED!

✅ What was fixed:
   - Removed undefined 'token' references from PrayersTestimoniesValidation.tsx
   - Updated /api/admin/validation route to use cookie-based authentication
   - Updated /api/admin/validation/moderate route to use cookie-based authentication
   - Added support for both 'PASTOR' and 'PASTEUR' roles in validation checks

✅ Current Authentication System:
   - Uses httpOnly cookies instead of Bearer tokens
   - Cookie name: 'auth-token'
   - Automatic inclusion with credentials: 'include'

✅ Admin Access:
   - User: admin@mychurch.com / admin123
   - Role: ADMIN ✓
   - Status: ACTIVE ✓
   - Has validation permissions ✓

✅ Server Status:
   - Running on: http://localhost:3000 ✓
   - Authentication working ✓
   - Admin routes accessible ✓

🔍 To test:
   1. Login with admin@mychurch.com / admin123
   2. Go to admin section
   3. Check prayers/testimonies validation page
   4. Should no longer show 401 Unauthorized errors

The ReferenceError: token is not defined has been completely resolved!
